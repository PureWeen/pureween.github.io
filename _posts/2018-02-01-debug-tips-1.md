### Setting up the source code
- Life is easiest if you can clone like this *git clone https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms.git d:\a\1\s*
- if you don't have a D drive then you can use *subst*
    - *git clone https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms.git c:\SomeFolder\a\1\s*
    - subst d: c:\SomeFolder
- Identify the tag/commit of the nuget package
    - If you go to the respoitory you will nice that the Forms tags have a consistent naming scheme
        - RC is the initial release and SR marks each additional release
            - For example *release-3.4.0-sr2* applies to *3.4.0.1029999*
        - Plans are pending to embed the commit id into the nuget which will make this easier
- Once you've identified the tag for the nuget release
    - git checkout tags/release-3.4.0-sr2

### Source Link
- Currently the Xamarin Debugger doesn't support SourceLink style debugging. The internal wheels are returning and once that is ready Forms will add SourceLink support

### Build scripts
- Currently working on build scripts (https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/5074)
